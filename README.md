This git repo is my Node.JS learning journey, i learned from the youtuber "The Net Ninja"
Built a little blog website that's linked into a mongodb Data Base, where you can add a title, snippet and a body for your blog
you can delete the blog once created and can create different blogs
If u copy this repo don't forget to replace <mongodb serv url> by the url of your data base ( mongodb )
